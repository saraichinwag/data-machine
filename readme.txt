AI-first WordPress plugin for visual pipeline automation, chat, and REST API control.

== Description ==

Data Machine is a powerful WordPress automation plugin that combines AI processing with visual workflow building. Create reusable pipeline templates, configure specific flow instances, and automate content workflows across multiple platforms.

**Key Features:**

* **Modern React Admin Interface** - Complete Pipelines page with 6,591 lines of React code using @wordpress/element and @wordpress/components
* **Zero jQuery/AJAX Architecture** - Modern React frontend with REST API integration
* **Tool-First AI** - Universal Engine architecture with multi-turn conversation loops and centralized tool execution
* **Visual Pipeline Builder** - Real-time updates with 50+ React components and Context API state management
* **Multi-Provider AI** - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, and OpenRouter (200+ models)
* **Complete REST API** - 16 endpoints for flow execution, pipeline management, and system monitoring
* **Chat API** - Conversational interface for building and executing workflows through natural language
* **Pipeline+Flow Architecture** - Pipelines are reusable templates, Flows are configured instances

**Requirements:**

* WordPress 6.9 or higher
* PHP 8.2 or higher
* Action Scheduler (woocommerce/action-scheduler)
* At least one AI provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, or OpenRouter)

**Example Workflow:**

Create a "Content Enhancement" pipeline with three steps: Fetch → AI → Update. Configure a flow instance to fetch old blog posts from WordPress, enhance them with AI using Google Search for research, then update the original posts with improved content.

**Available Handlers:**

Fetch Sources:
* Local/remote files
* RSS feeds
* Reddit posts
* WordPress (local posts, media, external sites via REST API)
* Google Sheets

Publish Destinations:
* Twitter, Bluesky, Threads, Facebook
* WordPress (with modular components for images, taxonomies, and source attribution)
* Google Sheets

Update Handlers:
* WordPress Update (modify existing posts/pages)

AI Tools:
* Google Search
* Local WordPress Search
* Web Fetch
* WordPress Post Reader

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What AI providers are supported? =

Data Machine supports OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, Grok (X.AI), and OpenRouter. OpenRouter provides access to 200+ models from multiple providers.

= Do I need to configure all AI providers? =

No, you only need to configure at least one AI provider to use Data Machine. You can add additional providers later.

= What external services does this plugin connect to? =

The plugin can connect to AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, OpenRouter), social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Bluesky), content sources (Reddit, Google Sheets), and optional tools (Google Custom Search). All connections are user-configured and opt-in only. See the External Services section for complete details.

= Does this plugin send data automatically? =

No. The plugin only connects to external services when you explicitly create and execute a workflow. No automatic connections are made without your configuration and execution.

= What is the difference between a Pipeline and a Flow? =

Pipelines are reusable templates that define the structure of a workflow (e.g., Fetch → AI → Publish). Flows are configured instances of pipelines with specific handlers and scheduling (e.g., RSS → OpenAI → Twitter, running hourly).

= Can I use this without the admin interface? =

Yes. Data Machine provides a complete REST API with 16 endpoints. You can execute flows, manage pipelines, and monitor jobs entirely via API calls. 

= How do I schedule automated workflows? =

When creating a flow instance, configure the scheduling settings to run at specific intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.). The plugin uses Action Scheduler for reliable background execution.

= Can I update existing WordPress posts? =

Yes. Use the WordPress Update handler in your workflow. The fetch handler provides a source_url that the update handler uses to identify which post to modify.

= Is there a file size limit for processing? =

The plugin can process files of various sizes. Web fetch operations have a 50K character limit. File uploads are subject to your WordPress/server upload limits.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to third-party services for AI processing, content fetching, and publishing. All external connections are **user-initiated** through workflow configuration. No data is sent to external services without explicit user setup and workflow execution.

= AI Providers (User Configured, Optional) =

Users must configure at least one AI provider to use Data Machine's workflow automation features. API keys and configuration are stored locally in your WordPress database.
