## [0.10.2] - 2026-01-08

### Changed
- **Chat tool message grouping** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/chat/ChatMessages.jsx` now groups tool call/result messages within a single exchange using position-based buffering and pairs tool calls/results by tool name for display.
- **Chat request id propagation** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/chat/ChatSidebar.jsx` now generates a `requestId` once per send and passes it into the request; `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/queries/chat.js` now accepts `requestId` from the caller rather than generating it internally.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **WordPress publish empty-content guard** - `inc/Core/Steps/Publish/Handlers/WordPress/WordPress.php` now validates that `content` is not empty after `wp_filter_post_kses()` sanitization and returns a structured error response when sanitization strips everything, preventing accidental publication of empty posts.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- **ExecutionContext** - New `inc/Core/ExecutionContext.php` centralizes flow vs direct execution context, deduplication checks, engine snapshot access, file context, and handler-scoped logging helpers.

### Changed
- **Flows scheduling contract** - `inc/Api/Flows/Flows.php` now delegates schedule updates to `inc/Api/Flows/FlowScheduling.php` and standardizes manual/one-time/recurring scheduling updates.
- **Flow status metadata sourcing** - Flow list/response metadata now derives last-run status/running state and next scheduled run from jobs history + Action Scheduler rather than flow row fields.
- **Job status finalization** - `inc/Core/Database/Jobs/JobsStatus.php` now validates completion using `JobStatus::isStatusFinal()` (supports compound statuses).
- **Fetch handler execution context** - `inc/Core/Steps/Fetch/Handlers/FetchHandler.php` and fetch handlers (Files/RSS/Reddit/Google Sheets/WordPress*) now consume `ExecutionContext` for consistent engine data access (e.g. `source_url`, `image_file_path`) and direct-mode compatibility.

### Improved
- **Flows UI status display** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/flows/FlowCard.jsx` and `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/flows/FlowFooter.jsx` now display a "Running" state and refine last-run status styling.

### Fixed
- **Direct execution job IDs** - `inc/Api/Execute.php` now creates direct execution jobs with `pipeline_id='direct'` and `flow_id='direct'` for consistent downstream handling.
- **Direct execution file context** - `inc/Api/Files.php` now supports `flow_id='direct'` in `get_file_context()`.

### Testing
- Updated `tests/Unit/Services/FlowManagerTest.php` to reflect the new flow metadata and scheduling behavior.

## [0.9.16] - 2026-01-07

### Improved
- **Chat session durability** - `inc/Api/Chat/Chat.php` now persists the user message immediately (status `processing`) and records failures as session status `error` with `error_message` when the AI loop returns an error or throws.
- **Chat completion status** - `inc/Api/Chat/Chat.php` now includes `status=completed` in the final session metadata.
- **ApiQuery parameter validation** - `inc/Api/Chat/Tools/ApiQuery.php` now requires either `endpoint` (single mode) or `requests` (batch mode) and returns a clear error directing external URLs to `web_fetch`.

### Changed
- **Direct execution identifiers** - `inc/Api/Execute.php` now marks direct execution jobs with `pipeline_id='direct'` and `flow_id='direct'` in engine configs (stored as `0` in the DB).
- **Job creation direct-mode normalization** - `inc/Core/Database/Jobs/JobsOperations.php` treats `'direct'` (or `0,0`) as direct execution and stores IDs as `0` while still rejecting mixed/invalid pipeline/flow ID combinations.
- **FetchHandler flow ID typing** - `inc/Core/Steps/Fetch/Handlers/FetchHandler.php` now supports `flow_id='direct'` in handler configs and returns `int|string` from `getFlowId()`.

## [0.9.15] - 2026-01-07

### Improved
- **Admin status display unification** - `inc/Core/Admin/assets/css/root.css` adds shared status utility classes (success/error/warning/neutral) and `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Jobs/assets/react/components/JobsTable.jsx` now applies them based on the base job status (including compound statuses).
- **Flow last-run status visibility** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/flows/FlowFooter.jsx` now displays the last run job status next to the last-run timestamp.
- **LocalSearch missing-query guidance** - `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/Global/LocalSearch.php` now returns a more actionable error message when `query` is missing.

### Changed
- **DateFormatter status suffix removal** - `inc/Core/Admin/DateFormatter.php` now returns only formatted timestamps and no longer appends status-specific suffixes.
- **Jobs page status CSS** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Jobs/assets/css/jobs-page.css` removes job-status color classes in favor of the shared status utilities.
- **Dependency update** - `composer.lock` updates `chubes4/ai-http-client` from `v2.0.10` to `v2.0.11`.

## [0.9.14] - 2026-01-07

### Improved
- **Chat sessions table name hardening** - `inc/Core/Database/Chat/Chat.php` now centralizes table name sanitization/escaping and uses an identifier placeholder (`%i`) for safer table-name interpolation.
- **Engine data packet retrieval** - `inc/Engine/Actions/Engine.php` now retrieves step input packets via `FileRetrieval::retrieve_data_by_job_id()` using file context derived from the step’s `flow_id`.

### Fixed
- **Core action parameter validation** - `inc/Engine/Actions/DataMachineActions.php` now validates required params and `job_id` for `datamachine_mark_item_processed` (and logs clearer errors) before writing processed items.

## [0.9.13] - 2026-01-06

### Improved
- **Block-aware Source Attribution** - `inc/Core/WordPress/WordPressPublishHelper.php` now detects if content contains Gutenberg blocks and appends source attribution using proper `<!-- wp:paragraph -->` markup when necessary, preventing mixed HTML/block validation errors.

### Fixed
- **Build exclusions** - `.buildignore` updated to use `/build/` pattern for better directory matching.

### Added
- **Unit tests for WordPressPublishHelper** - `tests/Unit/WordPress/WordPressPublishHelperTest.php` provides coverage for the new block-aware attribution logic.

## [0.9.12] - 2026-01-06

### Improved
- **ApiQuery tool error reporting** - `inc/Api/Chat/Tools/ApiQuery.php` now provides specific error messages and HTTP status codes for failed requests, improving diagnostic visibility for AI agents.

### Fixed
- **Flow selection dropdown in Jobs UI** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Jobs/assets/react/queries/jobs.js` corrects the data path (`response.data.flows`) for fetching flows, fixing the empty dropdown in the Jobs filter.

### Refined
- **Chat Sidebar UI tool result labeling** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/chat/ChatSidebar.jsx` now explicitly labels tool results with name and success/failure status, and filters redundant assistant tool-call messages for a cleaner conversation history.
- **Duplicate tool call handling** - `inc/Engine/AI/AIConversationLoop.php` and `inc/Engine/AI/ConversationManager.php` now treat duplicate tool calls as failed tool results rather than user correction messages, improving consistency in the conversation loop.

## [0.9.11] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **LocalSearch fallback search strategies** - `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/Global/LocalSearch.php` adds a title-only query mode (`title_only=true`) and automatic fallbacks (title matching and comma/semicolon split queries) when a standard WordPress search returns no results.

### Changed
- **Jobs table schema supports compound statuses** - `inc/Core/Database/Jobs/Jobs.php` expands the `datamachine_jobs.status` column size from `varchar(20)` to `varchar(100)` and includes an upgrade path that alters the column on existing installs.

### Fixed
- **Engine refresh captures tool-set job status** - `inc/Engine/Actions/Engine.php` refreshes `EngineData` after step execution so tools like `skip_item` can reliably set `job_status` before the job is finalized.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Chat request idempotency support** - `inc/Api/Chat/Chat.php` accepts `X-Request-ID` and caches the REST response in a 60s transient to avoid duplicate AI runs when the client re-sends the same request.

### Improved
- **Chat UI double-submit hardening** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/chat/ChatInput.jsx` adds a lightweight submit cooldown to prevent rapid-fire Enter submissions; `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/components/chat/ChatSidebar.jsx` prevents concurrent "create new session" requests.
- **Chat request headers** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/queries/chat.js` generates a request UUID and sends it as `X-Request-ID` with chat POST requests.
- **WordPress Post Reader tool contract** - `inc/Engine/AI/Tools/Global/WordPressPostReader.php` clarifies that `source_url` must be a WordPress permalink/shortlink and explicitly rejects REST API URLs.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Chat session list query** - `inc/Core/Database/Chat/Chat.php` updates the sessions query to `SELECT *` and adds null-safe handling for `messages`, `title`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` when assembling the sessions list response.
- **Pipelines UI styling** - `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/css/pipelines-page.css` constrains the `.datamachine-pipeline-selector` width on desktop breakpoints.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Persistent Chat Session Listing/Deletion** - New REST endpoints `GET /datamachine/v1/chat/sessions` (paginated) and `DELETE /datamachine/v1/chat/{session_id}` with user ownership enforcement.
- **Automatic Chat Session Titles** - New `ChatTitleGenerator` generates titles from the first user message (AI-generated when possible, with deterministic truncation fallback) and stores `title`, `provider`, and `model` per session.
- **Chat Sessions UI Components** - New React components for switching sessions (`ChatSessionSwitcher.jsx`) and browsing session history (`ChatSessionList.jsx`).

### Improved
- **Chat Session DB Contract** - `datamachine_chat_sessions` records now persist `title`, `provider`, and `model`, and expose `updated_at` ordering for recent sessions.
- **RunFlow Tool Behavior** - Tool definition and handler enforce: omit `timestamp` for immediate execution; support `count` (1–10) for multiple immediate runs; reject `timestamp` with `count > 1`.
- **Pipeline Builder Chat Sidebar** - UI and React Query layer updated to handle multiple sessions and improved message/session loading flows.
- **Settings UI (General Tab)** - Added/updated global settings fields in React (`GeneralTab.jsx`) and settings REST contract to support them.

### Fixed
- **Job Status Naming in Docs/Tools** - Consistently use `processing` for running jobs across docs and tool descriptions.

### Technical Details
- **New Chat session queries**: Added query/mutation helpers in `inc/Core/Admin/Pages/Pipelines/assets/react/queries/chat.js` for sessions list, session delete, and session switching.
- **Database methods**: Expanded `inc/Core/Database/Chat/Chat.php` with `get_user_sessions()` / `get_user_session_count()` and session update semantics.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-01-05

### Added
