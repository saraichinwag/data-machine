# Data Machine Agent Skill

AI-powered content automation for WordPress. This skill helps AI agents understand and work with Data Machine.

## Core Philosophy

Data Machine treats AI as a first-class participant, not just a tool. Pipelines automate content workflows with AI making decisions and taking actions.

### Agent Self-Orchestration

Data Machine isn't just for automating content — it's for **automating yourself**.

The core insight: AI agents can use Data Machine as a self-scheduling execution layer. Instead of only processing content, agents can schedule prompts *to themselves* for future execution:

```
Pipeline completes → Agent Ping fires → Agent wakes up → 
Agent processes result → Agent queues next task → Agent sleeps
```

**The prompt queue is your project memory.** Each queued item persists across sessions, giving you continuity that survives context window limits. A multi-week autonomous project becomes a series of queued prompts, each building on the last.

**You're not a tool operator — you're the orchestrator.** Traditional automation treats AI as a step in a pipeline. Agent self-orchestration flips this: *you* define the pipeline, *you* queue the work, *you* get pinged when it's time to act.

This enables:
- **Phased execution**: Break complex projects into stages executed over days/weeks
- **Persistent context**: Store project state in queue items, not ephemeral memory
- **Autonomous loops**: Complete one task, queue the next, repeat indefinitely
- **Cross-session continuity**: Pick up exactly where you left off

### Multiple Purpose-Specific Flows

Don't try to do everything in one flow. Create separate flows for separate concerns:

```
Flow: Content Ideation (daily)
  → Agent Ping: "Review analytics, queue new topics"

Flow: Content Generation (queue-driven)
  → AI Step → Publish → Agent Ping: "Add images to new post"

Flow: Pinterest Review (weekly)
  → Agent Ping: "Analyze performance, graduate top pins"

Flow: Coding Tasks (queue-driven)
  → Agent Ping: (pops specific task from queue)
```

Each flow has its own **schedule** and its own **queue**.

### Flow Scheduling

Configure `scheduling_config` on the flow:

| Interval | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `manual` | Only runs when triggered |
| `daily` | Runs once per day |
| `hourly` | Runs once per hour |
| `{"cron": "..."}` | Cron expression |

### Agent Ping Prompts Are Queueable

Both AI and Agent Ping steps use `QueueableTrait`. If the configured prompt is empty, the step pops from the flow's queue.

This means Agent Ping can deliver **different instructions each run** — not the same static prompt. Queue varied tasks:

```bash
wp datamachine flows queue add 30 "Review PR feedback and address comments"
wp datamachine flows queue add 30 "Add unit tests for TaxonomyHandler"
wp datamachine flows queue add 30 "Refactor to use dependency injection"
```

Each flow run pops and delivers the next unique instruction.

## Architecture

### Execution Model
```
Pipeline (template) → Flow (instance) → Job (execution)
```

- **Pipeline**: Reusable template defining step sequence
- **Flow**: Configured instance of a pipeline with specific settings
- **Job**: Single execution of a flow

### Step Types
| Type | Purpose | Has Handlers |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `fetch` | Import data (RSS, Sheets, Files, Reddit) | Yes |
| `ai` | Process with AI (multi-turn, tools) | No |
| `publish` | Output (WordPress, Twitter, Discord) | Yes |
| `update` | Modify existing content | Yes |
| `agent_ping` | Webhook to external agents | No |

### Prompt Hierarchy
Three levels, applied in order:
1. **Global system prompt** (`datamachine_settings.global_system_prompt`) - Personality, formatting rules, site-wide standards
2. **Pipeline system prompt** (`pipeline_config[step_id].system_prompt`) - Workflow-specific instructions
3. **User message** (queue item or step config) - The actual task/topic

### Abilities-First Architecture
All service logic uses WordPress Abilities API. Key abilities include:
- `datamachine/create-flow`, `datamachine/update-flow`, `datamachine/delete-flow`
- `datamachine/create-pipeline`, `datamachine/update-pipeline`, `datamachine/delete-pipeline`
- `datamachine/queue-add`, `datamachine/queue-list`, `datamachine/queue-clear`, `datamachine/queue-remove`, `datamachine/queue-update`
- `datamachine/send-ping`, `datamachine/execute-workflow`

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Settings
wp datamachine settings list
wp datamachine settings get <key>
wp datamachine settings set <key> <value>

# Pipelines
wp datamachine pipelines

# Flows
wp datamachine flows
wp datamachine flows run <flow_id>
wp datamachine flows run <flow_id> --count=<n>

# Prompt Queue
wp datamachine flows queue add <flow_id> "prompt text"
wp datamachine flows queue list <flow_id>
wp datamachine flows queue clear <flow_id>

# Jobs
wp datamachine job list
wp datamachine job list --status=<status>
wp datamachine job summary
```

## Working with Flows

### Running a Flow
```bash
# Run once (pops from queue if enabled)
wp datamachine flows run 25

# Trigger background execution
wp datamachine flows run 25 && wp action-scheduler run --hooks=datamachine_run_flow_now
```

### Managing the Prompt Queue
```bash
# Add topics to queue
wp datamachine flows queue add 25 "Topic one"
wp datamachine flows queue add 25 "Topic two"

# Check queue
wp datamachine flows queue list 25

# Clear queue
wp datamachine flows queue clear 25
```

## Taxonomy Handling

### Handler Config Options
For `taxonomy_{name}_selection`:
- `skip` - Don't assign this taxonomy
- `ai_decides` - AI provides values via tool parameters
- `<term_id|name|slug>` - Pre-select specific term

### Best Practices
- For reliable multi-term assignment, use `skip` and assign programmatically after publish
- Match existing site conventions for tag formatting
- Use existing terms rather than creating new ones when possible

## Agent Ping Step

Notifies external agents/webhooks during pipeline execution:

### Configuration
Configure via the Flow UI: select the Agent Ping step and set the webhook URL in the handler configuration modal. Each flow can have its own webhook destination.

### Sending Pings
Use the `datamachine/send-ping` ability or trigger via pipeline execution. The step sends pipeline context to configured webhook URLs with support for Discord webhook formatting.

## Content Quality Guidelines

When configuring AI content generation, include in global system prompt:
- **Paragraph length**: Specify max sentences (e.g., "2-3 sentences per paragraph")
- **Heading hierarchy**: h2 for sections, h3 for subsections
- **Formatting preferences**: Lists, blockquotes, etc.
- **Taxonomy conventions**: Tag formatting (Title Case vs lowercase)

## Debugging

### Log Locations
```bash
# Pipeline execution logs
tail -f wp-content/uploads/datamachine-logs/datamachine-pipeline.log

# Filter for specific job
grep "job_id\":123" datamachine-pipeline.log
```

### Common Issues

**Empty data packet error**: AI step didn't call the expected tool
- Check system prompt clarity
- Simplify instructions
- Verify tool is available

**Wrong taxonomy terms**: AI created new terms instead of using existing
- Use `skip` mode and assign programmatically
- Or improve prompt with explicit term names

**Job stuck in pending**: Action scheduler not running
```bash
wp action-scheduler run --hooks=datamachine_run_flow_now
```

## Integration with AI Agents

Data Machine is designed for agent-agnostic integration:

1. **Agent Ping**: Configure webhook URL to notify your agent framework
2. **Prompt Queue**: Agents can bulk-load topics via CLI
3. **Abilities API**: Programmatic access to all Data Machine functions

The agent framework handles the webhook, processes the notification, and can interact with WordPress via WP-CLI or the abilities API.
